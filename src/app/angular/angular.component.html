              <u>1.1.1 NgModules</u>
              <p>The main building blocks of an Angular project are <i>NgModules</i>. NgModules collects related code in functional blocks, 
                it is a container for cohesive block of codes, a workflow, ... . A Module can contain Components, service providers and other code files.
              A Module can export his own functionality for others to use and can import other modules for their functionality.</p>
              <p>An App always has at least one root module the enables bootstrap. The root module always has a root component, 
                but can have more additional components, which can be loaded through te router. Components in a module share a compilation context.</p>

              <p class="note">Image 1: A module with his components in their compilation context</p>
              <p>A component and its HTML-template define a view. A view hierarchy can mix views defined in components of 
                other modules</p>

              <u>1.1.2 Components</u>
              <p>Components define views. Set of screen elements that can be renderend on behalf of your programs logic and data.
                A component can render and change the DOM (Document Object Model). You can decorate a class with @Component. It is not 
                a compnent untill you defined it with the @Component              
              </p>
              <p>
                You define a view with its HTML template. The template will tell Angular how to render the page. 
              </p>

                  <li>curly brackets, (click), and [] bind program data to and from the DOM, responding to user input.</li>
                  <li>a component tag in the example is an element that represents a new component, 
                    HeroDetailComponent. The HeroDetailComponent (code not shown) is a child component of the HeroListComponent 
                    that defines the Hero-detail view. Notice how custom components like this mix seamlessly with native HTML in the same layouts.</li>

            <br/>
            <p>For manipulating data in the DOM, Angular supports one-way-bind and two-way-binding. No need for more explantion, 
              just look at the image beneath.

            <li>
              <u>1.1.3 Services</u>
            </li>
            <p>
                Services provide functionality that a view does not need to know. Services are injected into Components as dependencies.
                While a component just need to have data, it does not need to know where to fetch the data. This is why services are made.
              </p>
              <u>
                Dependency injection
              </u>
              <p>
                Components consumes services. You can inject services into components. You can do this through the <i>@Injectable</i> on a class.
                In the constructor of the component you can pass you service and the angular framework will inject this for you.
                constructor(private service: HeroService). If you injector already has a instance of that service, it will inject that instance,
                otherwise it will create a new instance.
              </p>
